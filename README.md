# Cue RMS Repository

This README should hopefully answer any questions you might have about setting up and getting started developing in this repository.

Please let Abby know if you have any issues, or find anything missing.

## Getting Started

The following assumes that you are working in `VSCode`, if you're using some other code editor/IDE, please check in with Abby to make sure that you have the correct configuration.

### Package Installation

Please make sure that you have `node.js` installed on your environment.

Once you've cloned the repository, run the following command within the repo directory to install all of the required packages, **you shouldn't have to manually install anything beyond this**.

```
npm install
```

### Formatter/Linter Installation

To ensure a common coding style and standard within this code base, we'll be using the `Prettier` formatter and the `ESLint` linter.

These have already been configured, so please install the Prettier and ESLint VSCode extensions to allow for formatting and linting on save.

_Please note that you might have to configure Prettier as your default formatter in the VSCode settings, and turn on format on save_

### Running the application

## Testing

_Coming soon..._
